# MockOutcyclingWebsite

This repository contains a simple static website for the OutCycling biking club.

## GitHub Pages
The site is ready to be served via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). To publish:
1. In your repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages**.
2. For the **Source**, select the `docs` folder on the `main` branch.
3. Save. GitHub will build and deploy the site at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.

The rendered site entry point is `docs/index.html` and it references assets using relative paths, so it will work from the published URL.

## Local preview
Open `docs/index.html` in your browser to view the site locally.
